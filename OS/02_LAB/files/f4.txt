Ibarra began another study, this time adding web entrepreneurs, lawyers, doctors, professors, and IT professionals.
The focus would be on career switching.
Ibarra tracked ambitious professionals, most in their thirties and forties, in the United States, United Kingdom, and France who had traveled a linear career path for a minimum of eight years.
Over the course of her work, she watched midcareer professionals move from a flicker of desire for change, to an unsettling period of transition, to the actual jump to a new career.
Occasionally she saw the entire process occur twice for the same individual.
When she compiled her findings, the central premise was at once simple and profound: we learn who we are only by living, and not before.
