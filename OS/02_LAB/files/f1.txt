Diversity was great, Hesselbein was told, but it was too much too soon.
Fix the organizational problems, and then worry about diversity.
But she had decided that diversity was the primary organizational problem, so she took it further.
She assembled a leadership team that represented her target audience, and modernized everything, from the mission statement to the merit badges.
There would now be badges for math and personal computing.
She made the gut-wrenching decision to sell campgrounds that volunteers and staff adored from their youth but that were no longer getting enough use.
Hesselbein remained CEO for thirteen years.
Under her leadership, minority membership tripled; Girl Scouts added a quarter million members and more than 130,000 new volunteers.
The cookie business grew to more than $300 million a year.
