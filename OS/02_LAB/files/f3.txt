After convincing his father (with his uncle’s help) that he would not become a deadbeat if he took this one detour, Darwin began perhaps the most impactful post-college gap year in history.
His father’s wishes eventually “died a natural death.

“It seems ludicrous that I once intended to be a clergyman,” he wrote.
His father, a doctor for more than sixty years, detested the sight of blood.
“If his father had given him any choice,” Darwin wrote, “nothing should have induced him to follow it.”
