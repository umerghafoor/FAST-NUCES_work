# Task 1: Byte Calculation

You have to create a UDP server and client. The client will send a message to the server and the
server will calculate the byte size of the message and send it back to the client. This
communication will continue until the client disconnects.

# Task 2: Palindrome check
Design a UDP server and client. The client will send the server a string and the server will have
to validate if the received string is a palindrome or not. The server will return “True” to the
client if the string is a palindrome. Otherwise it will return false
