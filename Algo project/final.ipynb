    "In this problem, the task is to assist Abdullah to make best use of his limited resources. He has some information available from intelligence wing of his organization. First, the rail line is completely linear which means that there are no branches, no spurs. Next, the Intelligence wing has assigned a Strategic Importance to each depot which is an integer from 1 to 5. Moreover, a depot is of no use on its own, it only has value if it is connected to other depots. The Strategic Value of the entire railroad is calculated by adding up the products of the Strategic Values for every pair of depots that are connected, directly or indirectly, by the rail line. Consider the following railroad:\n",
    "\n",
    "The strategic value of above railroad is computed as: 4*5 + 4*1 + 4*2 + 5*1 + 5*2 + 1*2 = 49. Now, suppose that Abdullah only has enough resources for one attack. He cannot attack the depots themselves because they are too well defended. He must attack the rail line between depots, in the middle of the desert. Consider what would happen if Abdullah attacked this rail line right in the middle:\n",
