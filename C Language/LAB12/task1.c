// Consider a simulation of a shared bank account, where multiple threads (representing bank clients) need to perform
// financial operations on the same account. These operations include deposits and withdrawals. The main challenge is
// to ensure that these operations do not interfere with each otherâ€”for example, a withdrawal should not start 
// processing based on an outdated balance if a deposit is meant to occur first.
// Your task is to implement a thread-safe management system for this bank account using mutexes to synchronize access 
// to the account balance. Specifically, ensure that:No two operations (deposit or withdrawal) can run concurrently,
// thereby avoiding any race conditions.Withdrawals do not proceed if the balance is insufficient, and no overdrafts
// are allowed.
// Write a C program using POSIX threads that:
// Initializes a bank account with a given balance.
// Creates multiple threads where each thread can either deposit or withdraw money.
// Uses mutexes to ensure that the balance updates are thread-safe and prevent race conditions.
// Prints out the account balance after all operations have completed to verify the correct sequence of operations.
