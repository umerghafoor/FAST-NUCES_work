# Matrix Calculator

In this project, we put a matrix system into place based on its hierarchy. A square matrix is required (i.e. rows and columns must be the same). The user is prompted by the application to enter the order (N) of matrix A and its components at first. The programme gives the user the option to complete the below-listed tasks in any order (1â€“8).

1. To display a matrix
2. To check whether the entered matrix is symmetric or not
3. To check whether the entered matrix is an identity matrix or not.
4. To determine the determinant of the entered matrix.
5. To determine the adjoint of an entered matrix.
6. To determine the inverse of an entered matrix.
7. To determine the solution of the entered matrix (i.e., solving multiple linear equations simultaneously)
8. To Arithmetic
